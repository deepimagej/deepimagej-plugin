### The ImageJ plugin to run deep-learning models

DeepImageJ is a user-friendly plugin that enables the use of a variety of pre-trained deep learning models in ImageJ. The plugin bridges the gap between deep learning and standard life-science applications. DeepImageJ runs image-to-image operations on a standard CPU-based computer and does not require any deep learning expertise.

## One-click Installation
The ZIP file (DeepImageJ.zip) is a plugin for ImageJ or Fiji. It contains all the necessary libraries (JAR files) to load and run TensorFlow models on any OS: Windows, Mac OSX, Linux.

Unzip the ZIP file and store the 5 JAR files into the plugins folder of ImageJ or Fiji.
