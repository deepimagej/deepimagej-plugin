# DeepImageJ

### The ImageJ plugin to run deep-learning models

DeepImageJ is a user-friendly plugin that enables the use of a variety of pre-trained deep learning models in ImageJ. The plugin bridges the gap between deep learning and standard life-science applications. DeepImageJ runs image-to-image operations on a standard CPU-based computer or on a GPU, and does not require any deep learning expertise.

Start using it with the guidelines in the [Wiki](https://github.com/deepimagej/deepimagej-plugin/wiki).
