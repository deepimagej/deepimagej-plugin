  /**
   * In order to impose tight security restrictions on untrusted classes but
   * not on trusted system classes, we have to be able to distinguish between
   * those types of classes. This is done by keeping track of how the classes
   * are loaded into the system. By definition, any class that the interpreter
   * loads directly from the CLASSPATH is trusted. This means that we can't
   * load untrusted code in that way--we can't load it with Class.forName().
   * Instead, we create a ClassLoader subclass to load the untrusted code.
   * This one loads classes from a specified directory (which should not
   * be part of the CLASSPATH).
